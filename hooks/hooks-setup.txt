_Implementing git-hooks_

* Install pandoc and mictex or basictex on your system.
* Move both the pre-commit and post-commit files to .git/hooks/ in your repository.

Whenever you make a commit, the hooks will automatically generate a .pdf version of the current yearbook.md file and add it to the commit.
