I am having a great time and alread learned a lot about git, which so far I have only used occassionally and in a very limited fashion. I am very much looking forward to the future classes and am excited about what's coming.

I want to go on a nice vacation somewhere warm to the sea. And I very much want to go back to my hometown and meet a lot of my friends who I mostly have not seen for over a year.
